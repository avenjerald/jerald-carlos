      <p class="space-mono-regular">
        I'm a front-end developer with a background in e-commerce and client
        services, now focused on building clean, responsive websites using HTML,
        CSS/ Tailwind CSS, JavaScript/ JQuery, and Shopify templates Liquid/
        JSON. After several years managing Shopify projects for clients in the
        UK and US, I transitioned into development to bring ideas to life more
        directly. I have hands-on experience with Shopify theme development,
        storefront customization, and integrating third-party apps. I’m
        comfortable working across teams, translating business goals into
        functional designs, and making sure the final product not only looks
        good but performs well. I care about details, communication, and
        creating websites that people actually enjoy using.
